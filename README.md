# RoboND-DeepLearning-Project

The objective of the Follow Me project was to create, and train, a fully convolutional network model, such that a target “Hero” person could be identified in simulated images of a city, via image segmentation, with an IOU of greater than 0.40.

The model and weights would then be fed to a simulated drone controller, to allow it to identify and follow the target.

This report outlines a successful implementation of the project, with discussion of the additional topics required in the rubric. The final Jupyter Notebook, and resulting weights file, are included alongside this submission.
